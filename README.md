## Project Overview

The Simple Program to Show Topics and Activities enables users to:

1. **Display Topic Details** (Title and Description).
2. **List Activities** associated with each topic.
3. **Show Activity Details** (Title, Type, and Description).

This system uses Python dictionaries and lists to manage topics and activities efficiently.

---

## Features

1. **Display Topics**  
   Users can view the title and description of each topic.

2. **List Activities**  
   Each topic's associated activities are listed with their details.

3. **Structured Output**  
   The program displays information in a clear and structured format.

## Data Structures

### Topic List Structure

The system uses a list of dictionaries to store topics, where each topic contains:

1. **Title**: The title of the topic.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the topic.
3. **Activities**: A list of activity IDs associated with the topic.

### Activity Dictionary Structure

The system uses a dictionary to store activities, where each activity is identified by an ID and contains:

1. **Title**: The title of the activity.
2. **Type**: The type of the activity (e.g., assignment, material).
3. **Description**: A brief description of the activity.
